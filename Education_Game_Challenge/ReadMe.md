Welcome to the Fannie Mae 2019 Education Game Challenge!

For this challenge you are tasked with building some type of online game (web-based, mobile, AR/VR, etc) that teaches High 
School and College students some of the basics around savings and credit.

The information to be taught is included in the document "Education_Game_Teaching_Content.pdf" in this folder. Please review the contents of this document and work to incorporate as many of the items included there in your game.

You and your team can build a games like:
 - Memory/quiz oriented game that provides a repetitive drill experience
 - A card based game similar to Magic: The Gathering where different concepts could represent different powers or actions
 - A cooperative game where players might all live in a house and need to budget for and purchase items. Their actions over the course of a game month or year might impact their ability to buy a house or a car, etc.
 - A board game like Life or Monopoly where landing on a particular square requires payment or receiving money or access to credit.
 
 Please be creative with your solutions and don't hesitate to ask questions from Fannie Mae folks at the table or via our Slack channel.

  Also, be aware there are a number of commercial and open source "game engines" you could utilize to develop your game including (but not limited to):
   - Unity (runs under Windows and Macintosh - there is a free version available) Javascript or C# based https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)
   - Blender - Python based - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)
   - Unreal - C++ - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine
   - Godot - C++ and C# - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)
   
   There are many other techniques and mechanisms you could use to develop your game - don't limit your thinking to just the tools listed above. You could build a memory/flash-card type game as a mobile or web app, or a matching tile game, or even a puzzle style game that uses similar or common concept as the intersection points.
